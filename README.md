# **concepts-python: Python practice**
PEY is a great time to bring back my unused skills and learn more skills such as python. Seems like labs from first-year? Well, better start late than never!

Project topics can be changed in planning stage.

**[WIP]** - working in progress

**[planned]** - planned exercise

[need details] - will be updated with details

## **Basic**
Basic python skills.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/

**_basic-1_**: Basic practice with basic data types (string, list, tuple, set, dictionary, array) 

**_basic-2_**: functions fundamentals - differentiation and integration approximation

**_basic-3_**: recursions - Factorial, Palindrome, Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi

**_basic-4_**: object oriented concepts - mobile phones

basic-5: exception handling **[planned]** [need details]

basic-6: python collections - counters, orderedDict, Defaultdict, Chainmap, ... **[planned]** [need details] -> Maybe divided into multiple 'basic' projects? If it is difficult then it will be moved to intermediate

## **Algorithms**
Revising algorithms and data structures course concepts (ECE345).

**_algo-1_**: basic mathematics **[planned]** [need details]
